    <p>Did you know flowers can be as delicious as they smell? think chocolate! Chocolate Cosmos; a flower that smells like fresh chocolate has earned its place as number one rarest flowers in my books. Native to Mexico and sadly extinct in it's natural habitat due to deforestation, this flower is still very unique and lives on. On the flip side as pretty as flowers are they can get pretty ugly and smell pretty ugly too...The Corpse Flower joins the group as one of the rarest flowers and one of the largest in the world. Blooming just once in a few decades it graces us the foulest smell of rotting flesh. How lovely would that be to smell? Alongside gracing us with this smell the corpse flower can reach up to 3.6 meters in height! It doesn't stop there as unique as this flower it, it is also set apart as it has no roots, leaves or even a stem! It grows as one petal in a shape similar to a cone.</p>
    <p>The third rarest flower is known as Youtan Poluo; blooms every 3,00 years and dates back to ancient times native to China and Taiwan. This flower is no more than 1 milimeter in diameter, their tiny size is not only a unique factor, making them completely white but they are known to be a symbol of immortality and reincarnation in the Budda's realm. </p>
