        <h3>Flowers are so much more than what meets the eye..</h3>
        <h3>Exploring the multifaceted world of flowers: The Rarest Blooms </h3>
    </header>
     <main>
    <p>Did you know flowers can be as delicious as they smell? think chocolate! Chocolate Cosmos; a flower that smells like fresh chocolate has earned its place as number one rarest flowers in my books. Native to Mexico and sadly extinct in it's natural habitat due to deforestation, this flower is still very unique and lives on. On the flip side as pretty as flowers are they can get pretty ugly and smell pretty ugly too...The Corpse Flower joins the group as one of the rarest flowers and one of the largest in the world. Blooming just once in a few decades it graces us the foulest smell of rotting flesh. How lovely would that be to smell? Alongside gracing us with this smell the corpse flower can reach up to 3.6 meters in height! It doesn't stop there as unique as this flower it, it is also set apart as it has no roots, leaves or even a stem! It grows as one petal in a shape similar to a cone.</p>
    <p>The third rarest flower is known as Youtan Poluo; blooms every 3,00 years and dates back to ancient times native to China and Taiwan. This flower is no more than 1 milimeter in diameter, their tiny size is not only a unique factor, making them completely white but they are known to be a symbol of immortality and reincarnation in the Budda's realm. </p>

    <h3>History of blooms around the world!</h3>
    <h3>The symbolism of flowers; meanings behind the worlds most famous blooms</h3>
        <p>From ancient civilisations to modern day expressions, flowers have carried symbolic weight, they tell stories of cultural beliefs, traditions and love.</p>
        <p>The four famous blooms that will be discussed are Roses, Tulips, Sunflowers and Peonies!</p>

        <p>Lets talk Roses:The history of roses is a captivating journey,its origins rooted in ancient times.Roses are well known as the symbol of love, with a complex history that relfects cultural significance, roses are traced back to over 5,000 years!</p>
        <p>Different civilisations first embraced roses for many different reasons. In ancient China, roses were cultivated for medicinal and aromatic uses which tied together with its significance around love and beauty. In ancient Egypt roses were used for fragrance in perfumes, cosmetics and offerings much attesting to their cultural importance. Not to forget Greece, where roses linked to Aphrodite, symbolised with love, its petals with luxury and beauty which further down the line transferred to traditions in Rome and made its mark on how we see Roses in contemporary society, the epitome of love and a token to every Valentines.</p>
        <blockquote>
            ''Life is about stopping to smell the roses, AND other blooms too'' <cite> Zaynab, 2024</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Tulips have been a popular flowers for centuries, a spring favourite. Did you know that almost half of 120 tulip species are native to central Asia? They thrive in all types of enviornments from extreme hot summers, harsh and cold winters, hence there powerful embrace and welcoming symbol of spring. As multicoloured and diverse as tulips are, they also belong to different groups. In fact, Daffodils, Dahlias and Tulips are divided into different versions and are characteristics of their flowers or when they start to bloom. In total there are fifteen and they include Lily-flowered, Rembrandt, Viridiflora, Parrot and Dawrin Hybrid groups!</p>
        <p>Sunflowers! Who doesn't love a bloom that easily brightens up any room? Infact, they date back to around 1000 BC in America and New Mexico. Sunflowers were first infact used for their seeds, sunflower seeds a popular seed to crush into flour for bread and later were utilised for their oil for both hair and cooking as it is packed filled with loving vitamins. Sunflowers got their name due to the fact that they move towards facing the sun, simply making the most out of that vitamin D. In many cultures such as Native American cultures sunflowers symbolise good luck and long life. They are also known as a spiritual flower hence they are always looking for the light. Even more interesting is the fact that there are six different colours of sunflowers! From the common yellow to red, orange, white, pink and purple! There are also many different types each differring mainly in height; Giant sunflowers, Dwarf sunflowers,Teddy Bear sunflowers, Multi-Branched sunflowers and Pollen- Free sunflowers. </p>
        <p>Peonies, the long awaited and well acclaimed symbol of spring, signalling the enterance of summer awaiting around the corner. Peonies are one of the larger spring flowers, its pastel colours typically grow in bushes and come with a fragrant beautiful smell. Peonies date back to 1,400 years to China and are a symbol for wealth, honor and happiness. Interestingly there are about 25- 40 different species of peonies, most are suitable for cool climates and are relatively low maintanence to keep alive once cut. Peony is the state flower of Indiana. With a background of symbolising honor, wealth and happiness they now rank one of the top sought after flowers for weddings! They are also very diverse, they trace back uses of peonies in medicine to sooth autoimmune disorders, PCOS and menstrual cramps. Not to mention they are extremely pretty with a variety of colours from pink, white, red and yellow.</p>

        <h2>Edible Flowers You Didn't Know You Could Eat! </h2>
        <h3>Did you know that flowers are more than just pretty faces in the garden? Many of them are edible and can add a burst of flavor and color to your culinary creations</h3>
        <h3>Seven flowers that are as pretty on the tastebuds as they are to the eyes!</h3>
    </header>
     <main>
    <p>When people think of food, we mostly think fruits, veggies and herbs. What about flowers? Suprisingly they can be delicious and packed full of vitamins and minerals too. Starting with our first flower; Pansies, these are small dainty flowers that have a mild lettuce taste to them. They can be used as a popular option for salads and a garnish on top of green dishes. Next up we have Chrysanthemums, the longest lasting blooms that keep up to a month at times can be eaten although they can differ in taste. Its pearly white petals can be hot and peppery to some and much milder blooms even can be tasted as sweet. You'll have to try a few different varieties and let me know which one tickles your tastebuds the most. Number three is Carnations, they taste peppery and somewhat like cloves, again a popular option to have in savoury salads and sweet deserts. Resturants top seceret is the cheesecake, a little carnation goes a long way in both look and taste. A very unusal stem that suprised me is Gladioli; there colourful petals can be eaten alone at that and have a differing lettuce like taste! A fan favourite is HoneySuckle; bringing a fragrant sweetness to jams, jellies and cakes, perhaps you already have this in your kitchen. Tulips back again! How interesting to know they can be used as little scoops of ice cream offering a sweet and slight peppery aftertaste and can be used in spring salads.</p>
        <p>Roses are used more so in the form of rose water which can add an intense rose flavour to a dish, although the petals are most popularly used as a garnish and addition to a range of recipes. Alliums! When you think of the flower version of lolipops think Alliums! They are the family of onion and chive flowers, which is ofcourse a very common and popular herb to use as a garnish.</p>
        <p>There are even edible flowers that are considered as weeds!</p>
        <p>The blooms of some garden 'weeds' are not only for wildlife! Dandelions are a common garden plant and can be edible both the stems and the leaves leaving a midly sweet tatse. Flower buds and the flowers can even be fried and truned into sweet or savoury fritters and the bright coloured flowers can be turned into wine or jellies!</p>
        <p>Lastly on our flower knowledge we have Daises, though they are nice to make chains with in summer and cover your lawn full of white pearly blooms, they are a overlooked edible food source! They can be eaten naturally in salads and sandwiches or even pickled as an alternative to capers.</p>
